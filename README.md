This is a project for CMPE286 at SJSU.

This is just an attempt to use Blynk IoT platform, so the focus of this project is more on trying out the platform rather than tuning and getting percise value from the sensor. Moreover, MQ135 is not a percise sensor to begin with, because of its low cost and the wide range of gases it detects.
